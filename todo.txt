# Work out acceleration from the lifting mass, mass of the ship and its inertia                     DONE
# Seperate program to create a table of max mass lift at each altitude
# Add Air resistance to the simulation.                                                             DONE                                     
        # Update to use the area of an ellipsoid (need to add height as well as diameter)
#Autopilot
        Need an autopilot to maintain set heights with engine thrust to compensate for any buoyancy trim issues
        Correct engine thrusting
#Currently, I'm directly controlling the airship x and y-axis velocity values. I would like to change that to using engine "thrust" and not be stuck in a strict X/Y separation EG thrust forward at 45 pitch up or something.
        This would require the "engines" to apply a thrust force not just play with the y/xvals
        Maybe to include fuel burn rates (and thus slowly decreasing mass as well)
