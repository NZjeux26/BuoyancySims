# Work out acceleration from the lifting mass, mass of the ship and its inertia                     DONE
# Seperate program to create a table of max mass lift at each altitude
# Add Air resistance to the simulation.                                                             DONE

        # Need Reference Area

#Drag in the x axis is creating acceleration when the ship moves backwards.
