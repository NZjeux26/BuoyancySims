# Buoyancy Simulator for AirshipACE

Doing a simple ISA buoyancy simulator/prototype in Python first to make sure all the math and values are correct without the restrictions of the amiga system getting in the way.

Currently, under tablesim.py the code is successfully replicating the International Standard Atmosphere.

It now integrates drag into its force calculations but the airship doesn't 'feel' quite right. It's not losing enough energy when traveling around as quickly as I would have thought, particularly in the Y-axis movement.

It's more than enough for AirshipACE purposes so anything further would be more for curiosity than anything.
