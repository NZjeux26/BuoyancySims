Formulas and Constants for Atmospheric Properties Calculation

1. Temperature at Altitude (ISA model):
   T = T0 - L * altitude

   Where:
   - T is the temperature at the given altitude.
   - T0 is the sea level temperature (288.15 K).
   - L is the temperature lapse rate (0.0065 K/m).
   - altitude is the input altitude.

2. Pressure at Altitude (ISA model):
   P = P0 * (1 - L * altitude / T0)^(g / (L * R))

   Where:
   - P is the pressure at the given altitude.
   - P0 is the sea level pressure (101325 Pa).
   - L is the temperature lapse rate (0.0065 K/m).
   - g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²).
   - R is the molar gas constant (8.314462 J/(mol·K)).
   - altitude is the input altitude.

3. Density at Altitude (Ideal Gas Law):
   ρ = (P * M) / (R * T)

   Where:
   - ρ is the density at the given altitude.
   - P is the pressure at the given altitude.
   - M is the molar mass of Earth's air (0.0289644 kg/mol).
   - R is the molar gas constant (8.314462 J/(mol·K)).
   - T is the temperature at the given altitude.

Constants:
- Sea level temperature (T0): 288.15 K
- Temperature lapse rate (L): 0.0065 K/m
- Sea level pressure (P0): 101325 Pa
- Acceleration due to gravity (g): 9.8 m/s²
- Molar gas constant (R): 8.314462 J/(mol·K)
- Molar mass of Earth's air (M): 0.0289644 kg/mol


Buoyant Force Calculation for Hydrogen Gas

Formula:
F_buoyant = ρ_fluid * V_displaced * g

Where:
- F_buoyant is the buoyant force (lifting force),
- ρ_fluid is the density of the fluid (hydrogen gas),
- V_displaced is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object,
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²).

For Hydrogen Gas:
- Density of Hydrogen (at STP): 0.08988 kg/m³

Buoyant Force Formula for Hydrogen Gas:
F_buoyant = Density_of_Hydrogen * Volume_of_Hydrogen * g

Note: Use consistent units for the calculation. If the volume is given in cubic meters, the density in kg/m³, and gravity in m/s², the result will be in Newtons (N), which is the unit of force.
