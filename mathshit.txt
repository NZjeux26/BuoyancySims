- Sea level pressure (P0): 101325 Pa
- Acceleration due to gravity (g): 9.8 m/s²

Buoyant Force Calculation for Hydrogen Gas

Formula:
F_buoyant = ρ_fluid * V_displaced * g

Where:
- F_buoyant is the buoyant force (lifting force),
- ρ_fluid is the density of the fluid (hydrogen gas),
- V_displaced is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object,
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²).

For Hydrogen Gas:
- Density of Hydrogen (at STP): 0.08988 kg/m³

Buoyant Force Formula for Hydrogen Gas:
F_buoyant = Density_of_Hydrogen * Volume_of_Hydrogen * g

Note: Use consistent units for the calculation. If the volume is given in cubic meters, the density in kg/m³, and gravity in m/s², the result will be in Newtons (N), which is the unit of force.

FB = (ρair - ρgas) × g × V
(1.292 - 0.090) kg/m3 = 1.202 kg/m3
1 m3 × 1.202 kg/m3 × 9.8 N/kg= 11.8 N <- In the Amiga version you could just precalculate this figure and then just read from a table or something.

That formula looks like: 
HL = V * 1.202 * 9.81
HL = Hydrogen lift in Newtons
V = Volume in Cubic meters
1.202 = Lifting capicity of hydrogen (1.202 KG per m3 of Hydrogen)
9.81 = Gravity

Newtons of an object is N = gravity * mass 

Acceleration with Buoyant Force:

1. Calculate Gravitational Force:
   F_gravity = m * g
   where:
     - m is the mass of the object
     - g is the acceleration due to gravity (approx. 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth)

2. Calculate Buoyant Force:
   F_buoyant = ρ * V * g
   where:
     - ρ is the density of the fluid
     - V is the volume of fluid displaced by the object

   If the object is fully submerged:
     V = m / ρ_object
     where ρ_object is the density of the object

3. Determine Net Force:
   F_net = F_buoyant - F_gravity

4. Calculate Acceleration:
   a = F_net / m

   v = a * time 

Current Airship is loosely based on LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin & the USS Los Angles

Drag Coefficent (USS Los Angles): 0.023

Propeller Thrust Calculation Formulas:

1. Basic Thrust Formula:
   T = η * ρ * A * V * (V - V₀)

   Where:
   - T is the thrust,
   - η is the propeller efficiency (0.7 to 0.9),
   - ρ is the air density,
   - A is the disc area swept by the propeller,
   - V is the effective airspeed,
   - V₀ is the airspeed of the aircraft (if any) in still air.

2. Disc Area (\(A\)) Calculation for Two-Bladed Propeller:
   A = π * (D/2)^2 (Area of a circle)

3. Disc Area (\(A\)) Calculation for Three-Bladed Propeller:
   A = (sqrt(3) * π * D²) / 4

   Where:
   - D is the diameter of the propeller.

OR sue the more correct formula
F = 0.5 * rho * A * (Ve^2 - V0^2)

Where:

F is the thrust (force) in Newtons
rho is the air density in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³)
A is the propeller disk area in square meters (m²)
Ve is the exit velocity of the air behind the propeller in meters per second (m/s)
V0 is the inflow velocity of the air entering the propeller in meters per second (m/s)

Engine Data
Fuel flow:
   100% = 19 Gallons per Hour
   50% = 8 Gallons per Hour
   Idle = 0.5 Gallons per Hour

Fuel mass is 0.719KG per Litre

**Converting Masses**
Just devide the mass by 1000 for big things and maybe a 100 for little things like ammo
